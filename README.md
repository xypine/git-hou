# git-hou

A quick and dirty reimplementation of [git-hours](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/git-hours) in rust.

## Why

The original project is a pain to run nowadays, since it's written for node.js 14.

## How it works

See [this](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/git-hours?tab=readme-ov-file#how-it-works) part of the original readme for an explanation of the algorithm.
